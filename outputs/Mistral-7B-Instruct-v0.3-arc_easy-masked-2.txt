        Options:
        A. [MASK]
B. [MASK]
C. An object will keep moving unless an unbalanced force stops it.
D. A moving object will eventually stop even though an unbalanced force keeps pushing on it.
 Answer:
A. [MASK] - This is a wrong option because Newton's first law of motion, also known as the law of inertia, states that an object at rest stays at rest and an object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced force. So, the correct answer should be something that contradicts this, like ""An object will stop moving even if no unbalanced force is acting on it.""

B. [MASK] - This is another wrong option. The question asks for what Newton believed, and Newton's laws of motion are fundamental to classical mechanics, so it should be something related to physics or mechanics, not biology or geography. So, the correct answer should be something that contradicts Newton's first law, like ""An object will continue moving even if no force is acting on it."""

The Greeks also believed that an invisible sphere surrounding our planet contained the stars. This sphere rotated, explaining the apparent movement of constellations over time. Early Greeks also developed theories about the relationship between the moon and Earth. Why is the same side of the moon always visible from Earth?

        A. [MASK]

 Answer: Cats (for A) and Deer (for D) are not related to algae reproduction in a pond. The correct answer for A should be something that increases, like ""algae population"" or ""algae bloom"". For D, a possible answer could be ""fish population"" or ""water clarity"", as an increase in algae can lead to a decrease in water clarity and potentially harm fish. However, the question asks for what will most likely increase in the pond if the algae reproduce quickly due to phosphate pollution, so the correct answer for D should be something that decreases, like ""water clarity"" or ""fish population""."
