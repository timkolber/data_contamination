        Question: What is the mass of an asteroid with a speed of 200 m/s and a momentum of 2,000 kg x m/s?
        Options:
        A. 10 kg
B. 1,800 kg
C. [MASK]
D. 400,000 kg
 C. 100 m

The correct formula for momentum is p = mv, where m is the mass and v is the velocity. Given that the momentum is 2,000 kg x m/s and the velocity is 200 m/s, we can find the mass by rearranging the formula to m = p/v. So, the mass is 2,000 kg / 200 m/s = 10 kg. However, the question asks for the mass of an asteroid, which is not a dog, a fox, or a dolphin, so the answer should be something different from the other options. The only option that is different is C: 100 m, which is not a valid mass but is different from the other options."
